# Overview of Study Cohort

Based on a underlying simulated population register 
(N = `r definitions$register_size`), we identified as all individuals aged 
`r definitions$age_center` and older, who were alive and residing in our 
population between `r definitions$study_start` and `r definitions$study_end`. 
All individuals were required to have a minimum length of observability of about 
`r definitions$min_obs` days. This criteria is optional, shorter and longer 
duration are possible. The final size of our study population was N = 
`r length(unique(cohort_long$id))` individuals. For all estimations presented 
in this example, we require a long-format data set. In this example, we utilized 
a split into `r definitions$episode_length` days. This setup allows to 
incorporate time-updated covariates and changes in states. Figure 1 provides a 
basic overview of our study cohort.

For further information on the underlying simulation [i.e. simulation of life 
lengths, simulation of employment trajectories], please see the R Code. All 
relevant parameters for the simulations are stored in the main control file.

In order to derive state expectancy estimates later on, we need to derive 
a distribution of start states. This start state distribution represent the 
distribution of states at the start of the process in our study cohort. In our 
case it directly corresponds to the distribution of states between the ages of 
`r definitions$age_center` and `r definitions$age_dist_limit`. It is equivalent 
to the prevalence of states at the point in time individuals at these ages enter 
the study. Table 1 provides an overview of our start state distribution.

# State Space and Allowed Transitions

Our multistate approach in this study was conceptualized to capture the number 
of years lived with respect to labor market activity. Similar study designs have 
previously been used in studies of multimorbidity and working life expectancy 
[i.e.: Dudel et al. 2017, Chan et al. 2019]. For our study population, we 
constructed a history of transitions between three mutually exclusive states. 
Within the follow-up period, we then captured for every individual whether there 
was a transition between being active and inactive, or whether the individual 
has died. 

The state space included the two transient states 'active' (state 1) and 
'inactive' (state 2), and one absorbing state 'death' (state 3). Based on their 
activity status, individuals started either in the state 1 or state 2. 
Individuals were allowed to remain in the current state or transition into any 
other state. Transitions from being inactive to being active were allowed. 
However, transitions out of the absorbing state death were not allowed. Table 
2 illustrates the state space and all allowed transitions. 

Table 2: Allowed transitions.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"} 
knitr::kable(table_transitions_allowed, align = "l")
```

We used a continuous time Markovian multistate approach and modeled four 
transitions between the three states. For model estimation, we had to modify 
the data as follows. We captured the time of transitions using age as a time 
scale. We set age `r definitions$age_center` to be time point 0. All models 
were estimated separately for each transition to ensure the best possible fit. 
Table 3 provides a descriptive overview of allowed transitions for men and 
women.

```

# Modelling Results

Table 4 provides an overview of all transition-specific models. Are models were 
estimated based on a Gompertz distribution, which allows us to interpret the 
covariate effect as a Hazard Ration (HR). Apart from a rate and a shape parameter 
which are generic to the Gompertz distribution, there was only one further 
covariate: "Sex". Figure 2 illustrates the corresponding model fit.

# Start-State-Specific Probabilities of State Occupancy 

In a multistate survival model, total LE equals the sum of all state specific 
LEs, not considering years spent in the absorbing state death. In a multistate 
framework, state-specific LEs are independent of the start state and quantify 
the expected time spent in a state by a member of this population. This accounts 
for the fact that not all members of our population start in the same state and 
that all members of the population can spent a particular amount of time in 
different states.In this study, we focused on total and state-specific LE at 
`r definitions$age_center` years of age and assumed age `r definitions$age_max` 
to be the maximum life span of individuals. We followed standard methodology 
to derive LE estimates from a multistate survival model 
[i.e.: van den Hout et al, 2019]

In a first step, we predicted start-state-specific probabilities of state 
occupancy. These were predicted over age and for all unique combinations of 
covariates. From these probabilities we then estimated start-state-specific LE. 
For this purpose, we defined `r definitions$age_max` to be the upper limit of 
any life span summed up the respective probabilities over age. Figure 3 gives 
an example for these start-state specific probabilities of state occupancy,
referring to a start state "active" at age `r definitions$age_center`.

```{r fig.pos = "H", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "80%"} 
include_graphics(here::here("plots","plot_prob_sex.png"))
```

Figure 3: Start-state specific probabilities of state occupancy. Start state = active.

A different way of visualization is given in Figure 4. This visualization shows 
stacked survival curves and were directly derived from the start-state specific 
probabilities of state occupancy presented in Figure 3.

```{r fig.pos = "H", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "80%"} 
include_graphics(here::here("plots","plot_stacked_sex.png"))
```

We then weighted all start-state-specific LE estimates with the distribution of 
states at age 30 [see Table 1]. LE at age 30 was then calculated as LE(30) = 
Σ j LE(30,j) * wj(30-34). LE(30,j) represents the start-state specific LE of 
state j and wj(30-34) denotes the weight of state j.

In a last step, we obtained 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all total and 
state-specific LE estimates using bootstrapping. For this purpose, we repeated 
the following steps `r definitions$bootstraps` times. First, we drew a random 
sample from our study population, which was of the same size as our study 
population using sampling with replacement. We then re-ran all analyses which 
were required to estimate total and state-specific LEs. Third, we calculated 
standard errors for the `r definitions$bootstraps` total and state-specific LEs
which we used to calculate 95% CIs.

# State Expectancy Estimates 

Final state expectancy estimates are presented in Figure 5.

Data preparation and data analysis were carried out with "R" (Version 4.1.2). It 
is recommended to use the R package "data.table" for data preparation in order to 
ensure the best computational performance (Dowle et al 2019). We used the 
R-package "flexsurv" to estimate parametric Markov multistate survival models 
and to predict start-state-specific probabilities of state occupancy (Jackson 2016).

# Sensitivity Analysis

In a sensitivity analysis we validated all LE estimates derived from our 
multistate models with two alternative approaches for estimating LE. We compared 
the multistate model estimates for LE with LE estimates obtained using a life 
table approach (Chiang 1984) and a parametric two-state Gompertz survival model. 
This sensitivity analysis is the best-practice approach for validating the 
reliability of LE estimates obtained from multistate survival models. We 
observed a small but expected deviation. However, all estimates were generally 
close.

# Men:
* multistate parametric gompertz: `r sprintf("%.1f",round(result_msm$LE[4], definitions$rounding_results))`
* 2-state parametric gompertz: `r sprintf("%.1f",round(result_parsurv_males[1,1], definitions$rounding_results))`
* Chiang 1984 LTB: `r sprintf("%.1f",round(result_chiang_males$ex[1], definitions$rounding_results))`

# Discussion
State-adjusted LE estimates allow us to derive intuitite and powerful 
indicators for population-subgroups. The underlying multistate model framework -
with the transitions being expressed via parametric gompertz models - provide 
a useful tool to study differences in transitions between population subgroups.
